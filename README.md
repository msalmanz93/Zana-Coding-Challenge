# Zana-Coding-Challenge

# Task 1
fastText is a library for learning of word embeddings and text classification. It makes available pre-trained word vectors in various languages. Create a Python script which:
a. Retrieves the word vectors for the English language and prints out their dimension (Hint: you may optionally make use of the Gensim
library)
b. Read the word vectors for all the words in the small dataset of three sentences below and save the vectors in a CSV document.
  1. What are the main symptoms of diabetes?
  2. Tell me how I may treat bruxism
  3. What is the cause of a stroke?
  c. Upload the script and the CSV document in Github; send the link.
  
# Task 2
