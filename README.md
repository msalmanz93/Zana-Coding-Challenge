# Task 1
fastText is a library for learning of word embeddings and text classification. It makes available pre-trained word vectors in various languages. Create a Python script which:
a. Retrieves the word vectors for the English language and prints out their dimension (Hint: you may optionally make use of the Gensim
library)
b. Read the word vectors for all the words in the small dataset of three sentences below and save the vectors in a CSV document.
  1. What are the main symptoms of diabetes?
  2. Tell me how I may treat bruxism
  3. What is the cause of a stroke?
c. Upload the script and the CSV document in Github; send the link.
  
Result: I was successful in getting the dimension of English Language which is 300 and also word-vectors of the above dataset sentence wise/word wise but I couldn't save it in a CSV document.

# Task 2
Create a supervised intent classification model using TensorFlow with at least one of the following a) a dataset in TensorFlow, b) dataset of your choice, c) the dataset under this link: https://cloud.zana.com/index.php/s/gjMy4m6mqQREcyH

Result: I built a model using Tensorflow and tflearn with my own dataset in JSON format.
